## Importing Data

The project starts by importing necessary libraries and loading the labeled oil dataset from ARFF files.

## Data Exploration

Exploratory data analysis is performed, including visualizations of feature distributions and relationships between features.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, dropping unused columns, and cleaning labels.

## DNN Model

A deep neural network (DNN) model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras. The architecture includes multiple dense layers with dropout for regularization.

## Training the Model

The model is trained on the preprocessed dataset using the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical crossentropy loss.

## Results

The results of the training process, including accuracy and loss metrics, are discussed.
